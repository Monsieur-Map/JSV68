        REACTION OFF-FIELD DPS BUILD FOR VENTI This build prioritizes damage over Energy Recharge (ER) due to Venti's ER ascension stat. This weapon order assumes the use of Electro Venti. Favonius Warbow: Although ineffective for personal damage, this weapon allows Venti to provide more energy for his teammates while meeting his ER requirements. Pursuing Crit Rate in substats is recommended for consistent passive procs. If Venti deals significant damage through Elemental Reactions or triggers other Elemental Reactions, the value of this weapon decreases. Elegy for the End: The ATK buff of Elegy for the End does not affect Venti's burst if he equips the bow, but the EM buff enhances his Swirl reaction. Due to Venti's burst snapshotting his stats (excluding EM for transformative reactions like Swirl) at the time of cast, the party-wide ATK and EM buffs from Elegy for the End can be more beneficial in terms of total team damage and comfortable ER. Although an R1 Elegy for the End yields slightly lower Venti damage compared to an R5 Stringless (~7% assuming 50% Elegy buff uptime), it offers party-wide ATK and EM buffs which can be advantageous. Cloudforged: This weapon offers the most Elemental Mastery of any weapon. Venti can reliably achieve two stacks of the passive if he uses his Burst at least every 18s, making its performance slightly better than stated here. Alley Hunter and Mouun's Moon: At R5, these weapons outperform Favonius Warbow. ANEMO OFF-FIELD DPS FOR VENTI (RECOMMENDED ONLY IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS) This build is recommended only when Venti receives numerous buffs from teammates (e.g., Bennett, Faruzan) and does not trigger reactions such as Aggravate or Electro-Charged. Elegy for the End: Elegy is roughly equal to Alley Hunter in terms of DPS, but its teamwide buffs make it a more worthwhile choice on Venti. Regarding Mainstats: Goblet: The Goblet can be ATK% or
