        **Physical DPS** Optimal Physical Rotation: Normal Attack until Spear Kick -> Dodge/Jump Cancel -> Repeat **Shield Support** This playstyle is very straightforward; stack as much HP as possible. Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage. If paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable. **Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority** Crit Rate should only be considered when Zhongli is equipping Favonius Lance to reliably proc the passive. **Weapon Choices** Favonius Lance: Use this weapon over Black Tassel if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive) **Artifact Sets** Archaic Petra (4): Can be more useful than Tenacity of the Millelith (4) in teams that don't scale as well with ATK buffs or already have another Tenacity of the Millelith holder. Though it can be an awkward set to utilize well without extending rotation times, since the Holder of the set (Zhongli in this case) has to pickup the shard for the buff to take effect. Tenacity of the Millelith (4): This set is best in slot for Shield HP, but it's usually inconsistent against Bosses and needs good Construct placement, due to its inconsistency, it's better to use other buffing sets that are mentioned if they work for the team. Deepwood Memories (4): This set works best in Dendro reaction focused teams (Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom/Spread) that prefer having Deepwood Memories on Zhongli so that they can run more damage focused sets such as Gilded Dreams / Flower of Paradise Lost instead for the highest overall damage gain. That said it means keeping the enemies near your pillar's to have good uptime on the Dendro resistance shred effect, which can be difficult with no grouping abilities in a team. Instructor (4): This set is usually only used in a few heavily reaction focused teams, such as Ganyu Melt or Hu Tao Vape, where you're maximising your damage in exchange for a weaker shield. Though Zhongli's shield is still usually more than strong enough even with fewer substat rolls to strengthen it. **Burst Support** Zhongli can be utilized as a Geo Burst damage dealer due to his short Elemental Burst cooldown (12s) and low energy cost (40 Energy). His Elemental Skill Hold Cast (Shield) scales with HP and at Ascension 4, you would unlock a talent that allows your Elemental Burst to scale with 33% of Zhongli's Max HP, making him a great source of Shield and damage. Though in certain teams without either very high investment into his damage or enough time in the rotation to burst without extending rotation times his burst can be a DPS loss. **Weapon Choices** Favonius Lance: If the team values the particles from this weapon, then it can be better than all the other options mentioned for overall team damage (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running Favonius Lance to trigger the passive) **Artifact Main Stats** ATK sands provides more damage than HP sands, but it does have lesser Shield HP. If you want more Shield HP, you can consider running a HP sands. **Artifact Sets** Noblesse Oblige (2) Archaic Petra (2): On lower ER requirements where Zhongli doesn't need to worry about his energy needs, this set pulls ahead of Emblem of Severed Fate (4). Noblesse Oblige (4): This set provides Zhongli more utility when casting his Elemental Burst, you can use this set on Zhongli if there is nobody else on the team who's equipping this set. Tenacity of the Millelith (4): Just like Noblesse Oblige (4), this set provides Zhongli with more utility if his Elemental Skill hits an enemy. This set also provides Zhongli with stronger shields.
