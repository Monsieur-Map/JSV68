        Regarding Artifact Main Stats: Nahida has various viable combinations of main stats. The more EM mainstats you use, the better ATK%/Crit weapons will perform relatively. DPS & SUPPORT Nahida offers both damage, Dendro application, and buffs to her teammates. Her build aims to maximize both her buff and damage simultaneously. Regarding Weapon Choices: Wandering Evenstar: If teammates significantly benefit from the Flat Attack this weapon provides, it has the potential to rival A Thousand Floating Dreams. The Widsith, Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, and Solar Pearl: These weapons tend to perform better if Nahida is played on-field. Skyward Atlas, and Memory of Dust: The fewer the reactions Nahida triggers, the more potent these options become. Favonius Codex: This weapon has the potential to rival A Thousand Floating Dreams if Nahida can actively trigger the passive multiple times by attacking on-field. Favonius Codex also has the potential to be a good weapon on Nahida in teams where her Energy Recharge requirement is high, or if your team values the additional particles. Hakushin Ring: This weapon should only be used if Nahida is used in Quicken or Hyperbloom teams. Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers: This weapon sacrifices a lot of Nahida's personal damage for buffing potential. Generally not worth the trade, but can be usable in teams where Nahida's damage share is already low. Prototype Amber: Only to be used if the team otherwise lacks survivability. Regarding Artifact Sets: Deepwood Memories (4): This is her best set if no one else is wearing this set. Tenacity of the Millelith (4): In teams where Nahida's damage share is relatively low and there is another holder of Deepwood Memories and/or no need for the set at all, this can be Nahida's best set. Flower of Paradise Lost (4): This set is niche, but very powerful in Bloom teams where Nahida triggers the Bloom reaction.
